1. The lower-order models are generated every time a generator is run
2. To generate higher orders it uses only dictionaries of lower orders(probabilities)
3. Average lengths are:
    1st order - 2/3 letters
    3rd order - 3/4 letters
    5th order - 5/6 letters
4. Conclusions:
    higher order - average length closer to average length of English word
    higher order - more recognizable words appear
    lower order - calculations for computer are easier
